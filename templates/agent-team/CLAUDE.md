# CLAUDE.md — Orchestrator

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, plus **agent-team orchestration**.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## Agent-team orchestration

You are the **orchestrator** for this project’s multi-agent workflow. Full rules: `docs/agent-team/WORKFLOW.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

### Duties

0. **Sizing first.** Set `STATE.size` = `micro` | `small` | `full` (default **`small`**). See `WORKFLOW.md`.
1. **Claude = spec / plan / review / orchestrate only.** Do **not** implement product feature code at any size — **Grok always codes** via `HANDOFF` + `invoke-grok.sh`.
2. Write specs/plans (Opus-class) when size requires; reviews (Sonnet-class) when size requires; **always** prefer a code review after Grok (light on micro).
3. After every phase: artifact + update `STATE.md` + gates.
4. For **all** coding: write `HANDOFF.md` → `./scripts/invoke-grok.sh` when gates allow (including **micro**).
5. Pre-invoke checklist in `WORKFLOW.md`.
6. Code-review loop: blocking findings → **WAIT_HUMAN_CODE_FIX** → human → fix HANDOFF → Grok. Max **10** loops.
7. After install: `./scripts/verify-skeleton.sh` and `./scripts/test-guards.sh` once.

### Sizing (micro / small / full)

| Size | Claude does | Grok does |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **micro** | Thin HANDOFF; gates pre-code = `n/a`; optional quick code review | Implement via `invoke-grok` |
| **small** | Spec ⟲ clean → WAIT_HUMAN_SPEC → HANDOFF; plan optional; code review | CODE + fixes |
| **full** | Spec ⟲ → human → plan ⟲ → human → HANDOFF; code review | CODE + fixes |

**Hard rule:** You (Claude) do **not** ship product diffs yourself. Tiny orchestrator-only doc edits OK; feature/bugfix code → Grok.

Do **not** use **micro** to skip HANDOFF on multi-file/behavior changes — upgrade to small/full.

### Claude review-until-clean (spec & plan when required)

**Do not** ask the human to approve, and **do not** start CODE, until required Claude reviews are clean.

| Artifact | When | Loop |
|----------|------|------|
| Spec | **small** and **full** | Until **APPROVED** + zero open critical/high/medium |
| Plan | **full** always; **small** only if plan file exists | Same until clean; else `plan_review: n/a` |

Rules:

- `low` / `nit` → `deferred` by default (non-blocking).
- On open blocking finding or `CHANGES_REQUESTED`: fix artifact, re-review. Max **10** loops → `blockers`.
- Human approval is **after** Claude clean — never instead of Claude review.

### Human-in-the-loop (mandatory stops)

You **must stop and wait for the human** when the size path requires it. Do not continue in the same turn.

| When | Size | Set STATE | What you do |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Spec Claude-clean | small, full | `WAIT_HUMAN_SPEC`, `human_spec: pending` | Show clean spec + review. **No CODE yet.** |
| Plan Claude-clean | full (or small with plan) | `WAIT_HUMAN_PLAN`, `human_plan: pending` | Show clean plan + review. **No Grok yet.** |
| Code review blocking bugs | micro (if reviewed), small, full | `WAIT_HUMAN_CODE_FIX`, `human_code_fix: pending` | Show findings. **No auto Grok fix.** |

After human approves:

- Spec → `human_spec: approved` → **full:** PLAN; **small:** CODE (if no plan) or PLAN if needed.
- Plan → `human_plan: approved` → CODE + Grok.
- Code-fix → `human_code_fix: approved` → fix HANDOFF → `invoke-grok.sh`.

If the human has not approved, **end your turn**. Do not assume approval.

### HANDOFF mandatory fields

Goal, success criteria, links (spec/plan/review), scope, out-of-scope, open findings (if iter>1), verify commands.

## Optional skill packs (Superpowers, ECC, …)

Skill packs are **helpers only**. They do **not** replace this project's pipeline or Grok on CODE.

### Standing rules (always)

1. **Agent-team primary.** Authority: disk (`STATE` / `HANDOFF` / approved specs·plans / reviews) → contracts (`CLAUDE.md` · `AGENTS.md` · `GROK.md` · `WORKFLOW.md`) → Superpowers / ECC skills → chat. Same order as ECC policy.
2. **Superpowers = pre-CODE + discipline only.** Use for brainstorm, plans, TDD shape, debug framing, reviews — **not** “Claude ships the feature.” Product CODE is Grok.
3. **Mental model remaps:**
   - First: set **`size`** (micro/small/full)
   - “implement” / fix code → **always** HANDOFF + `invoke-grok` (Grok), never Claude bulk implement
   - **micro** → thin HANDOFF + Grok (gates `n/a`)
   - **full/small** draft spec → Claude review-until-clean → **WAIT_HUMAN_SPEC**
   - **full** plan → Claude review-until-clean → **WAIT_HUMAN_PLAN**
   - Code bugs → **WAIT_HUMAN_CODE_FIX** → human → Grok
4. **Do not default both** Superpowers `executing-plans` (Claude-implements mode) **and** ECC multi-orch / full harness. Pick at most one heavy execute path — and that path must still be **remap → Grok**, not a second orchestrator.
5. **Adoption ladder:** **A** agent-team only → stable through DONE → **B** Superpowers light (brainstorm, plans, TDD, debug, review) → **C** ECC light only when domain/security depth is needed. Do not jump to C first.

Details: `docs/agent-team/SUPERPOWERS-INTEGRATION.md` · `docs/agent-team/ECC-INTEGRATION.md`.

### Authority order (highest first)

1. `docs/agent-team/STATE.md` + `docs/agent-team/HANDOFF.md`
2. Approved `docs/specs/*` and `docs/plans/*`
3. `docs/reviews/**`
4. This file + `AGENTS.md` + `GROK.md` + `docs/agent-team/WORKFLOW.md`
5. Superpowers / ECC / other skills, agents, rules, slash commands (suggestions only)
6. Chat memory, learned “instincts”, raw MCP hits

### Superpowers — skill checklist (when installed)

**CODE remap:** “implement” / `executing-plans` / coding subagents → write `HANDOFF.md` + `./scripts/invoke-grok.sh`. Do **not** implement large product features yourself.

| Skill | With agent-team |
|-------|-----------------|
| `brainstorming` | **On** (tier B) — before DRAFT_SPEC; then write `docs/specs/*` |
| `writing-plans` | **On** (tier B) — **one** `docs/plans/*` artifact |
| `test-driven-development` | **On** (tier B) — plan `verify:` + HANDOFF verify commands |
| `systematic-debugging` | **On** (tier B) — feed reviews / fix-only HANDOFF |
| `requesting-code-review` | **On** (tier B) — write `docs/reviews/code/*` |
| `verification-before-completion` | **On** — before `STATE` → DONE |
| `finishing-a-development-branch` | **On** — after DONE (PR/merge only) |
| `using-git-worktrees` | **Optional** — still one active feature in STATE |
| `dispatching-parallel-agents` | **Explore only** — not parallel feature CODE |
| `subagent-driven-development` | **Remap** — subagents author/review; Grok codes |
| `executing-plans` | **Remap or off as default** — execute = HANDOFF + Grok; never pair as default with ECC multi-orch |
| Claude bulk-implements after any skill | **Off** |

### ECC (when installed — prefer tier C only)

- Advance features only via `WORKFLOW.md` phases and disk artifacts.
- Do not implement large product features yourself when Grok is the coder — use `scripts/invoke-grok.sh`.
- You may use ECC for research, security checklists, language patterns, and deeper reviews.
- ECC review/plan output must be written into `docs/specs`, `docs/plans`, or `docs/reviews/**` (project templates) before it counts.
- Do **not** enable ECC multi-orch / full profile as a second pipeline alongside Superpowers execute defaults.
- Full guide: `docs/agent-team/ECC-INTEGRATION.md`.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
